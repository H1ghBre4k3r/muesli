### Hi there 👋

What's this? A mysterious secret page? Shhh, don't tell anyone!
Want your own awesome profile page? Check out [readme-scribe](https://github.com/muesli/readme-scribe)!

I'm Chris, an open-source enthusiast and avid contributor. I'm the author of Beehive, Knoxite, Tomahawk and a bunch
of other projects. Curious what I've been hacking on recently?

(Love the logo on the right as much as I do? The awesome [Christian Rocha](https://github.com/meowgorithm/) made it!)
